# Product Guide: PromptArchitect-Studio

## Vision & Purpose
PromptArchitect-Studio is a professional-grade prompt engineering workbench designed to transform raw ideas into structured, high-performing AI instructions. By leveraging the CO-STAR framework, the studio ensures that LLM interactions are reliable, repeatable, and optimized for specific business or technical outcomes.

## Target Audience
The studio serves a diverse group of AI practitioners:
- **Developers:** Building and testing complex prompt chains for LLM-powered applications.
- **Prompt Engineers:** Utilizing structured methodologies to refine model performance.
- **Business Analysts & Non-Technical Users:** Accessing sophisticated AI engineering techniques through an intuitive, guided interface.

## Strategic Goals
- **Framework Standardization:** Establishing CO-STAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response) as the core standard for prompt construction.
- **Quality & Reliability:** Significantly improving the output quality of LLMs through precision engineering.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Providing a seamless experience for experimentation, versioning, and persistence of prompt architectures.

## Core Feature Set
- **CO-STAR Architect:** A multi-stage builder that guides users through context setting, objective definition, and output constraints.
- **Persistence & History:** Comprehensive tracking of prompt versions, with the ability to favorite and revisit high-performing architectures.
- **Personalization:** User-specific settings for default models and theme persistence across sessions.
- **Hybrid Engine Support:** Native integration with Google Gemini for cloud scale and Ollama (Llama 3.2) for local, privacy-focused execution.

## Quality Standards
- **Performance:** Sub-second response times for the transformation engine and UI interactions.
- **Mobile-First & PWA:** Installable application experience with touch-optimized interfaces and tactile feedback.
- **Privacy First:** Secure handling of user prompts and encrypted storage of API credentials.
- **Seamless Portability:** Container-first architecture ensuring identical behavior across local, dev, and production environments (Docker/Supabase).

## User Experience & Aesthetic
PromptArchitect-Studio adheres to a **Premium Studio Aesthetic**. The UI is characterized by sophisticated typography, subtle motion design, and a focused workspace that minimizes distraction while maximizing the engineering experience.
