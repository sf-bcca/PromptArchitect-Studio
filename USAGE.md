# Usage Guide

## Overview

PromptArchitect-Studio is a tool designed to help you engineer high-quality prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses an AI-powered backend to refine your basic ideas into structured, professional prompts.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter Your Idea**
    *   In the main input box, describe what you want to achieve in plain English.
    *   *Example:* "I need a prompt to help me write a python script for scraping a website."
    *   *Example:* "Create a persona for a fitness coach who is strict but encouraging."

2.  **Engineer the Prompt**
    *   Click the **"Transform Prompt"** button.
    *   The system will process your request using the Gemini 3 Flash model via our secure backend.

3.  **Review the Results**
    *   **Refined Prompt:** The main output. This is the engineered prompt you can copy and paste into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
    *   **Why This Works:** An explanation of the techniques used (e.g., persona assignment, constraints).
    *   **Suggested Variables:** Dynamic parts of the prompt you might want to customize (e.g., `[Target Audience]`, `[Tone]`).

4.  **History**
    *   Your recent prompts are saved automatically.
