## 2024-05-23 - Missing Input Length Validation **Vulnerability:** The `engineer-prompt` Supabase Edge Function processed user input without checking its length. **Learning:** Serverless functions are often billed by execution time or resources. Unbounded input can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting memory or CPU, or financial DoS by consuming excessive tokens/resources. **Prevention:** Always validate `input.length` for any string parameter before processing it, especially before passing it to an LLM or database.
